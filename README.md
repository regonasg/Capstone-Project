Description of Project
------
“SHIKSHA The Planner” is a web-based application that will help students keep track of past, present and future classes. Students   sometimes struggle to keep organized and that will put them behind in their classes. This application will help negate one problem and keep track of their classes to let them visualize where they stand. This allows information like grades and assignment due dates to be saved and updated by the users. SHIKSHA will have a sign up and login page, the ability to add up to six courses and its corresponding labs (if any). Inside the courses, users will have the ability to add their desired grades, assignments, exams and due dates and add in grades. User’s GPAs will also be calculated by them adding classes already taken from past semesters. An academic planner will also be included for users to plan out their future classes and when they wish to finish.
